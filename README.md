# Arduino Keyboard
> It's a stupid project for an attempt at making a custom keyboard using multiple Arduino UNOs, all the code and wiring are hosted here.

## Wiring

I have no clue at the moment...

## Keyboard Wiring Materials

> Buttons, it's always buttons...

## Requirments and Building for Use

### Windows

1. Use the diagram **(coming soon)** and wire up your keyboard
2. Use the Arduino IDE to upload the [Keyboard Listener Code](src/KeyboardListener/KeyboardListener.ino) to your Arduino UNO: [Quick Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQfC72VeV7Y)
3. Run the [Start](out/start.exe) file

## Requirments and Building for Development

### Windows

This codebase requires Python 3 and the libraries `pyserial` and `pynput`. You can run both (requires pip to be installed):
```
pip install pyserial
pip install pynput
```
